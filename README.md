# Face-And-Liveness-Detection-Based-Bank-Locker-Security-System

My project name is Face And Liveness Detection Based Bank Locker Security System. This project uses CNN algorithm for face recognition. In this project, only authenticated user can access the lockers as faces are stored for the individual identity of a person. Facial recognition cannot determine whether the person is real or not. Therefore, liveness detection is implemented. In liveness detection, the system detects if it interacts with a real person or a spoof artefact used by other person such as a face photo. To detect whether the person is live or not the project uses eye blink detection. The project identiÔ¨Åes whether the user is authenticate or not. If not then, the locker will not open instead it will raise an alert and immediately the system will capture photograph of that person and that photograph will be emailed to the user. In this way, the system provides high security, theft protection and alert of bank locker. Software required: Python 3.8.0 VS Code.
